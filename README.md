## [Menstruation Twitter Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/LoveYourMenses/twitter-attitudes/)
Objective: To understand key topics and themes, and prevailing sentiments of menstruation related conversations on Twitter
- Scraped tweets by keyword from Twitter using snscrape
- Processed tweets using NLP techniques including tokenization and lemmatization
- Fit Short Text Topic Modeling (STTM) algorithm to tweets with k=5 to create clusters of tweets with common topic categories
- Employed VADER sentiment analysis tool to analyze polarity of tweets by respective topic

## [Marketing Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/jacksondfuller/customer_segmentation)
Objective: To identify distinct segments in the current customer base in order to target future marketing campaigns
- Processed and cleaned dataset, explored outliers and correlations between variables
- Reduced dimensionality using principal component analysis (PCA)
